## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this UIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the Union ecosystem? What use cases does this proposal address?

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
All UIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The UIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. UIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for UIPs that are affecting the core contracts. Other UIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any UIP is given status "Final", but  need not be completed before the UIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## Security Consideration
All UIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.
